- **Relevance of P2P in the Browser**: Introduce WebRTC and WebSockets as tools enabling P2P connections in the browser, with abrief description of their differences and typical use cases.
- **Purpose and Scope**: Define the focus on security aspects like authentication, identification, and authenticity in P2P networks using WebRTC and WebSockets.

### 2. **Technical Background**

- **P2P Communication in Browsers**: Explore how WebRTC and WebSockets work, especially in the context of establishing direct connections between peers. Discuss connection establishment protocols (e.g., STUN/TURN for WebRTC) and how WebSockets facilitate data transmission.
- **Security Fundamentals**: Briefly introduce security terms and concepts, including authentication, identification, and authenticity. Describe their importance for securing P2P networks.

### 3. **Authentication in P2P Networks**

- **Overview of Authentication**: Explain what authentication means in P2P contexts and why it is challenging due to the lack of centralized control.
- **WebRTC and WebSockets Authentication Mechanisms**:
  - **WebRTC**: Describe how identity tokens or certificates are used in WebRTC for authenticating peers. Cover security concerns related to certificates and possible MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) risks.
  - **WebSockets**: Outline common authentication approaches for WebSocket connections, such as token-based authentication and encrypted WebSocket (WSS).
- **Challenges and Limitations**: Discuss issues, such as managing and securing identity providers, token expiry, and the use of third-party authentication services.

### 4. **Identification in P2P Networks**

- **Identification vs. Authentication**: Explain the difference and why both are necessary in P2P security.
- **Methods for Peer Identification in WebRTC and WebSockets**:
  - **WebRTC**: Discuss peer identification methods, such as unique IDs associated with signaling servers or IP-based identification.
  - **WebSockets**: Describe identification challenges and methods, such as using custom headers or unique IDs.
- **Security Concerns**: Cover vulnerabilities like impersonation, IP spoofing, and potential identity leaks.

### 5. **Authenticity and Data Integrity**

- **Importance of Authenticity in P2P Networks**: Explain why ensuring the authenticity of data is crucial to prevent attacks, like data tampering.
- **Mechanisms to Ensure Authenticity**:
  - **Encryption**: Explain how encryption (e.g., DTLS for WebRTC) ensures that data comes from an authentic source.
    - DTLS-SRTP
  - **Integrity Checks**: Discuss techniques like hashing to validate data integrity.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Detail countermeasures against authenticity-based attacks, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) and replay attacks.
